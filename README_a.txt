To The Edge

Controls:
W/Up Arrow - Move Forward
S/Down Arrow - Move Backwards
A/Left Arrow - Rotate Counterclockwise
D/Right Arrow - Rotate Clockwise
Backspace - Restart Level
Escape - Exit Game

Running into a kill volume will disable the player and require a restart, and
running into the win volume will disable the player and display the win text.
I am planning to include particle effects on wins, losses, and movement as well
as sound effects and background music. I also plan to include several lock and
key type of mechanics as power ups that the player will be able to use to
complete the level.
