To The Edge

Controls:
W/Up Arrow - Move Forward
S/Down Arrow - Move Backwards
A/Left Arrow - Rotate Counterclockwise
D/Right Arrow - Rotate Clockwise
Backspace - Restart Level
Escape - Exit Game
Q - Shade Powerup (Go Through Purple Blocks)
E - Sol Powerup (Ignore Kill Volumes)
Space - Shoot Charge Laser (Breaks Blue Blocks)

The Q, E, and Space controls only work after acquiring their respective
powerups. There are UI popups on player death with instructions on how to
restart, player victory, and UI popups on acquiring each of the powerups that
explains how to use it. In addition, each of the powerups has a screen flash
of its color that flashes when the player picks it up, and the player ship
changes colors to reflect the powerups that have been obtained. There are
particle and sound effects on all the important features, and I added a bullet
and destructible system as an innovative system. Once unlocked, the player can
spawn bullets that destroy certain geometry.
